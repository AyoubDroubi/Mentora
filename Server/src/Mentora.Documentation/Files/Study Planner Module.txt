Software Requirements (SWR)
Study Planner Module

1. Overview
The Study Planner module provides tools that help users organize, track, and improve their study habits. It
consists of six core features: Pomodoro Timer, ToDo List, Planner (Calendar & Events), Attendance &
Overall Progress, Notes, and Study Quiz.

2. General Rules
All endpoints require JWT authentication. Data is user-scoped, persisted using GUIDs, and timestamps
are stored in UTC.

3. Pomodoro Timer
Completed Pomodoro sessions are stored in the database and used to calculate total studied time.
Studied time is aggregated in minutes and displayed as hours and minutes (e.g., 124h 15m).

4. ToDo List
Users can create, complete, filter, and delete ToDo items. Tasks are stored per user and reflected
immediately in progress calculations.

5. Planner (Calendar & Events)
Users can create events with a title and date/time, view events by calendar day, see upcoming events, and
mark events as attended.

6. Attendance & Progress
Overall progress (0–100%) is calculated based on completed ToDo tasks (50%) and attended planner
events (50%).

7. Notes
Users can create, view, and delete personal study notes which are stored persistently.

8. Study Quiz
A diagnostic quiz helps understand user study behavior and generates a personalized study plan based on
answers.

9. Backend Summary
The backend must implement persistence, aggregation logic, JWT scoping, and clean APIs for all Study
Planner features.

Software Requirements (SWR)
Module: Study Planner
1. Overview

The Study Planner module provides tools that help users organize, track, and improve their study habits.
It consists of six core features:

Pomodoro Timer

ToDo List

Planner (Calendar & Events)

Attendance & Overall Progress Percentage

Notes

Study Quiz (Diagnostic)

All features are user-specific, persisted in the database, and accessed through authenticated APIs.

2. General Rules (Applies to All Features)
2.1 Authentication

All endpoints must require JWT authentication.

UserId must be extracted from the token.

Users may only access their own data.

2.2 Data & Persistence

All entities use GUID as primary key.

Store timestamps in UTC.

Soft delete (IsDeleted) is recommended for user-generated content.

3. Feature 1 — Pomodoro Timer (Study Sessions)
3.1 Objective

Allow users to study using a Pomodoro timer and track total studied time based on completed sessions.

3.2 Functional Requirements

FR-PT-01
The system shall allow the user to start a Pomodoro session.

FR-PT-02
When a session is completed, the system shall store a Study Session record in the database.

FR-PT-03
Only completed sessions shall contribute to the total studied time.

FR-PT-04
Cancelled or interrupted sessions shall not be counted.

FR-PT-05
Studied time shall be calculated in minutes, aggregated across all completed sessions.

FR-PT-06
The total studied time shall be displayed as:
{hours}h {minutes}m
Example: 124h 15m

3.3 Data Model — StudySession
Field	Type
Id	Guid
UserId	Guid
DurationMinutes	int
CreatedAtUtc	DateTime
3.4 API Endpoints

POST /api/study-sessions
Saves a completed Pomodoro session.

GET /api/study-sessions/summary
Returns:

{
  "totalMinutes": 7455,
  "formatted": "124h 15m"
}

3.5 Acceptance Criteria

Completing a Pomodoro session updates the studied time on the Study Planner main page.

Studied time persists across refresh and login sessions.

4. Feature 2 — ToDo List
4.1 Objective

Allow users to manage a personal task list.

4.2 Functional Requirements

FR-TD-01
The system shall allow users to create ToDo items.

FR-TD-02
Each ToDo item shall be displayed with a checkbox.

FR-TD-03
Users shall be able to mark ToDo items as completed.

FR-TD-04
Users shall be able to filter ToDo items by:

All

Active

Completed

FR-TD-05
Users shall be able to delete ToDo items, which removes them from the database.

4.3 Data Model — TodoItem
Field	Type
Id	Guid
UserId	Guid
Title	string
IsCompleted	bool
CreatedAtUtc	DateTime
IsDeleted	bool
4.4 API Endpoints

POST /api/todos

GET /api/todos?filter=all|active|completed

PATCH /api/todos/{id}

DELETE /api/todos/{id}

5. Feature 3 — Planner (Calendar & Events)
5.1 Objective

Allow users to plan and view study-related events using a calendar.

5.2 Functional Requirements

FR-PL-01
The system shall allow users to create events with:

Title

Date & Time

FR-PL-02
Events shall be stored and retrieved from the database.

FR-PL-03
Clicking a day in the calendar shall display events for that day.

FR-PL-04
An “Upcoming Events” list shall display all future events.

FR-PL-05
Users shall be able to mark an event as Attended.

FR-PL-06
Attended events shall contribute to the overall progress percentage.

5.3 Data Model — PlannerEvent
